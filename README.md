# Exploring Prognostic Factors and Treatment Outcomes in Back Pain Management

## Project Overview
This project investigates the association between prognostic factors and treatment outcomes in back pain management. Using data from Anderson (1984), the study applies categorical data analysis techniques to understand how factors like prior back pain duration, changes in pain intensity, and spinal lordosis affect pain progression after treatment.

## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from the R package `gnm`, includes 101 individuals and four key variables:
- **x1**: Length of prior back pain episodes (Short/Long)
- **x2**: Change in pain intensity (Better/Same/Worse)
- **x3**: Spinal lordosis (Absent/Present)
- **Pain**: Pain progression after treatment (6 ordered categories: Worse to Complete Relief)
